## Overview

I applied my knowledge of programming principles to solve linear optimization problems from my math elective <b>MATH 340 - Linear Programming</b>. 

This involved writing <b>Jupyter Notebook</b> files using the <b>PuLP</b> Library in <b>Python</b>.

To better explain the scenarios detailed in the homework, I described the mathematical concepts and formulation of the linear programming problem using `LaTex` in the `.ipynb` files.

### Project Ideas

I have written a [short essay](Linear_Programming_History.pdf) on the development of <b>Linear Programming</b>, which also touches on its wide usage in different economical applications. 

I have had the idea to use <b>Linear Programming</b> and <b>PuLP</b> in a larger <b>Sudoku</b> Game Project. As shown in the following script [(`Sudoku2.py`)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coin-or/pulp/master/examples/Sudoku2.py), this can be used to find the solutions to the game.
